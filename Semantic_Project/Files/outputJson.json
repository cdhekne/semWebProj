Without inclusion of the code and data with published computational results, we are engendering a credibility crisis in science. Controversies such as ClimateGate, the microarray-based drug sensitivity clinical trials under investigation at Duke University, and retractions from prominent journals due to unverified code suggest the need for greater transparency in our computational science. In this talk I argue that the scientific method be restored to (1) a focus on error control as central to scientific communication and (2) complete communication of the underlying methodology producing the results, ie. reproducibility. I outline barriers to these goals based on recent survey work (Stodden 2010), and suggest solutions such as the “Reproducible Research Standard” (Stodden 2009), giving open licensing options designed to create an intellectual property framework for scientists consonant with longstanding scientific norms."}

To illustrate, I will describe three examples of research that would have been extremely difficult, or even impossible, to perform just a decade ago: (1) using email exchange to track social networks evolving in time; (2) using a web-based experiment to study the collective consequences of social influence on decision making; and (3) using a social networking site to study the difference between perceived and actual homogeneity of attitudes among friends.

At the nation’s flagship newspaper, The New York Times, there’s a relentless commitment to high-quality journalism, whether print or digital, Jill Abramson maintains. “The fact that people have come to expect news on the web to be free has certainly challenged journalism’s business model,” she acknowledges, but The Times is better positioned than other publications to weather the changes. Indeed, “decades from now, the quality newspapers left may not be on paper, but journalism will continue to thrive,” Abramson asserts. In particular, this means ramping up science coverage, whether examining climate science or common medical treatments and health policy.  Abramson draws a clear distinction between science blogs, which are “often for the deeply engaged,” and “coverage pitched to the intelligent general reader.” Penetrating reporting with great breadth comes at a steep price: the paper must support reporters who dig deep into protected government files, are on perilous assignments, or must take a year to glean all dimensions of a complex story. She asks, “How do we prevent the collective muscle of investigative journalism from being gutted?” Whatever the answer (and one solution may involve nonprofit funding), Abramson sees a robust, continuing appetite for “trustworthy information on the world we live in.”  Cristine Russell sees a “best of times, worst of times” scenario for science journalism, with a glut of opportunities beyond print to chat and blog about science, or more frequently, health and fitness, and deep cutbacks in print science departments. Andrew Revkin admits the days when The Times could bring in $1 billion a year in ad revenue are gone forever, and hopes its staff “won’t be in a museum of recently extinct journalists.” But holes in science coverage mean “scientists have a greater responsibility to take the bull by the horns…and engage more fully in a conversation with society.” Ivan Oransky characterizes some online science sites as a kind of “curation,” with “a lot of people covering single events periodically.” He cites Twitter as a positive example of “democratizing coverage,” getting a new generation “to get back into science.” Evan Hadingham suggests we might be “in a golden age of popular science communication on TV.” Yet, in a 500-channel world, public TV science producers face “the ghettoization of science,” worried about how to mix serious science with entertainment."}

This confluence of ideas is not limited to abstract ideas about how trial and error learning should proceed, but rather, current views regarding the computational roles of extremely important brain substances (such as dopamine) and brain areas (such as the basal ganglia) draw heavily from reinforcement learning. The results of this growing line of research stand to contribute not only to neuroscience and psychology, but also to machine learning: human and animal brains are remarkably adept at learning new tasks in an uncertain, dynamic and extremely complex world. Understanding how the brain implements reinforcement learning efficiently may suggest similar solutions to engineering and artificial intelligent problems. This tutorial will present the current state of the study of neural reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on both what it teaches us about the brain, and what it teaches us about reinforcement learning.     Target Audience:  The target audience are researchers working in the field of reinforcement learning, who are interested in the current state-of-the-art of neuroscientific applications of this theoretical framework, as well as researchers working in related fields of machine learning such as engineering and robotics. Familiarity/basic knowledge of reinforcement learning (MDPs, dynamic programming, online temporal difference methods) will be assumed; basic knowledge in neuroscience or psychology will not.     Tutorial outline:  Introduction: A coarse-grain overview of the brain and what we currently know about how it works  Learning and decision making in animals and humans: is this really a reinforcement learning problem?  Dopamine and prediction errors: what we know about dopamine, why we think it computes a temporal difference prediction error, and why should we care? Evidence for the prediction error hypothesis of dopamine  Actor/Critic architectures in the basal ganglia: a distribution of functions in a learning network  SARSA versus Q-learning: can dopamine reveal what algorithm the brain actually uses?  Multiple learning systems in the brain: what is the evidence for both model based and model free reinforcement learning systems in the brain, why have more than one system, and how to arbitrate between them  Beyond phasic dopamine: average reward reinforcement learning, tonic dopamine and the control of response vigor  Risk and reinforcement learning: can the brain tell us something about learning of the variance of rewards?  Open challenges and future directions: what more can reinforcement learning teach us about the brain, and where can we expect the brain to teach us about reinforcement learning?"}

Our work over the past 15 years has focused on taking advantages of these opportunities. Our neuroscience research investigates the neural basis of motor, language, and cognitive function by applying computational techniques to recordings from the surface of the brain (electrocorticography (ECoG)) in humans.  For example, we study how local field potentials in different cortical areas prepare for and execute hand or finger movements.  Our neuroengineering research is taking advantage of the resulting neuroscientific understanding and aims to address particular clinical problems.  This work includes statistical signal processing, machine learning, and real-time system design and implementation.  For example, we have been developing a new real-time imaging technique for invasive brain surgery. In this talk, I will describe the types of signals that can be detected in ECoG and the emerging understanding of their physiological origin.  I will then demonstrate that ECoG encodes detailed aspects of function, such as actual or imagined speech.  Finally, I will show demonstrations of ECoG-based communication and control, and of our real-time passive functional mapping technique.  Overall, this talk aims to communicate the substantial research and emerging commercial opportunities that arise from integration of neuroscience and neuroengineering, and hopes to inspire the neurotechnology community to participate in them."}

Wieman is convinced that science education must be improved, not simply to inspire and train the next generation of scientists, but to educate a citizenry “to make wise decisions on tough questions.”  Unhappy with the apparent lack of impact his undergraduate physics courses had on students, Wieman began a personal odyssey to discover why traditional methods of teaching science -- the massive lecture hall, the fact-filled lectures -- seemed to fail in the task of conveying key concepts, much less exciting listeners. He delved into cognitive psychology research, and learned that when students are passive, they retain a mere 10% of the facts conveyed to them, and that indeed, the human brain has a limited amount of RAM. Our working memory can hold around seven items. In addition, students simply “do not develop a good understanding of concepts by hearing them explained in lectures.” The brain is like a muscle that must be built up, especially the structures involving long-term memory, Wieman learned, and “to develop the brain requires a strenuous effort over a long time.”  Wieman then pursued notions of effective teaching practices, those that would allow students to develop their own understanding, by “thinking hard about a subject and then monitoring and guiding that thinking.” The pedagogical principles he ultimately distilled include: employing an expert individual tutor to motivate, pose questions to and interact with students; and probing “where students are starting from and connect with them,” finding ways to have students challenge, explain and critique each other, with feedback from the tutor.  Wieman acknowledges the difficulty of deploying these methods in a large class, but suggests utilizing technology to assist. He finds particularly helpful interactive lectures with hand-held clickers to help gauge student understanding. Wieman also advocates highly interactive simulations, enabling students to “build a circuit on computers,” for instance. He also backs homework problems “that go toward building expert thinking,” part of the effortful practice the brain needs to generate more proteins for long term memory. Ultimately, we “must approach teaching like we do science,” says Wieman, testing the effectiveness of different methods and putting the results of such research to use in the classroom."}

But for solar cells to help eliminate our dependence on fossil fuels, says Emanuel Sachs, they’ll need to provide trillions of watts of power -- and we are “still a thousand fold from where we need to be.” Sachs’ “photovoltaic grand challenge” involves building hundreds of billions of solar cells annually, which may come about through new manufacturing processes. And don’t discount other renewables, like wind farms. New proposals avoid the “Not in my Bay” effect, by placing floating turbines in deep water beyond sight.    While the sun offers a source of unlimited energy, we can’t take advantage of it without better storage systems. In particular, says Yet-Ming Chiang, we need to improve lithium ion batteries – the same kind found in our cell phones and laptops. The current generation of these batteries, when used for large-scale storage, tends to burst into flames. Chiang’s lab is working on improving the chemistry so these batteries could be deployed for residential solar power, and in hybrid vehicles, where they would offer environmentally friendly energy at low cost.    The total amount of biomass harvested in this country could “comprise up to 40% of the U.S. demand for liquid fuels,” says Gregory Stephanopoulos. Take a crop like switch grass, break it down to simple sugars, then use microorganisms to convert the sugars to useful molecules like ethanol. The energy equation improves if we use cellulosic crops instead of corn, and capture carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. The cost of this conversion process has dropped radically in the last 10 years, from one dollar a gallon to 10 cents a gallon. But hurdles remain, including improved metabolic engineering of an array of microbes.    What’s not to like about fusion? Jeffrey Freidberg tells us that the reactor process is safe; we have one billion year’s worth of fuel in reserve; there’s no release of greenhouse gases or particulates; and there’s no leftover fissile material to worry about. But there’s one big problem, Freidberg says: “It doesn’t work yet.” For decades, the joke has been that fusion is the energy source of the future and always will be. But, Freidberg says, we’ve “nearly solved all the scientific problems.” An international consortium has begun building an experimental $4 billion fusion reactor in France. Freidberg concludes, “It will take 30 years to build a demonstration power plant-- and this time, we’re serious.”    The most critical ingredient in designing cleaner energy systems may well be nanotechnology, according to Gang Chen. Manipulating materials at the atomic level can alter their fundamental properties. This means better conductivity, with less resistance and heat output, allowing for more efficient power generation, batteries and fuel cells. “You can change the game of energy conversion,” says Chen. Researchers are scaling up manufacturing processes for super-lattice thin films integral to storage and energy conversion systems. In the future, Chen sees nanotechnology as “the enabler,” helping combine new energy systems for transportation and residential buildings."}

Concern about the considerable waste of human resources and the persistence of institutional discrimination impeding women’s scientific careers has prompted a number of significant documents and concerted action at the trans-national level designed to tackle these entrenched problems. Although female participation in science has increased in recent decades, women are still rarely seen in top scientific positions, such as professorships or other high-level research positions. Career opportunities in science are determined by a number of complex factors, which cannot easily be described using simple statistical indicators. ‘Internal’ factors (which depend on the organization, operation, and structuring of the scientific community itself) play an important role. The internal factors interact with ‘external’ factors, which are determined and shaped by society at large – such as existing gender roles inside and outside the family, the changing status of women with regard to education and the labor market, and the political framework. The existing differences, based on the historical and political background from different countries, must not stand in the way of women of Europe coming together as a unified force to develop a common strategy and agenda for realizing gender equality in science in an enlarged Europe. Women in the East and the West still know too little and display sometime limited interest in what what’s happening on the ‘other side’. Women in the East express high hopes that the legal rights and directives of the EU and higher standards of the older members of the EU will have a positive impact on gender equality policies in the Eastern European countries. Using gender sensitive indicators and statistics, this lecture will present an overview of the presence and participation of women in science, and will show gender-specific patterns of career opportunities in Western and Eastern European countries. A short presentation of the existing efforts at European level in promoting gender equality in science and increasing the proportion of women scientists will be also shown. It will be outlined the initiatives, additional measures that need to be taken in order to strengthen the role of female scientists at regional and European level. References"}

This course will examine the public policy behind and the government\u0027s role in the science and technology innovation system. Given the challenges to future federal science support, this seminar will aim to equip those planning careers in and around science and technology with a basic background for involvement in science policymaking. This course is offered during MIT\u0027s Independent Activities Period (IAP), which is a special 4-week term at MIT that runs from the first week of January until the end of the month. It features student-led discussion incorporated into the course structure as well as opportunities to interact with MIT students and faculty involved in aspects of science policy. The course has been offered since 2006 and has developed as a collaborative effort between the instructor and MIT students from the Science Policy Initiative."}

Kastner describes four areas “in order of increasing difficulty” the new president must address:    The president’s first move should be to increase the prestige of science in government, by giving the science advisor a more important role, listening carefully to career scientists in government agencies, and encouraging rather than punishing them for speaking out.    Second, Kastner advises expanding basic research on energy and environment. The U.S. imports $700 billion worth of oil per year, placing the nation “in jeopardy economically and politically,” says Kastner. Clean energy is likely to be a huge industry, and if the U.S. is to lead worldwide, it must begin to master a cluster of technologies that together pose our best chance of beating climate change.    We need a huge infusion of R\u0026D money in such thorny areas as: carbon sequestration (we don’t yet know if CO2 can be efficiently and safely injected into underground pore space); electrical storage, where we need a five-fold improvement in battery technology to produce an all-electric car that can run for 200 miles; solar energy, where current solar cells are made from materials that are too costly, and not yet efficient enough. While federal and private energy research has been declining, the International Energy Agency estimates the world will require $17 trillion dollars to stabilize CO2emissions between now and 2050.    The third order of business involves biology: Having teased apart the DNA molecule and mapped the genome, we now stand ready for a third revolution in life science, says Kastner. This will involve the convergence of biology with mathematics, physics and engineering. Says Kastner: “The gigantic amount of data being generated by rapid sequencing requires new approaches: biology needs theory for the first time, needs integrating ideas to explore information and come up with clarity.”    The final and perhaps toughest job involves stabilizing science funding. Over the past 20 years, math, physical science and engineering funding have remained flat. In the life sciences it doubled (partly due to 9/11), then declined. While “it’s wonderful to give more money to science,” rapid increases over short times have often been followed by sharp dips, creating major research disruptions. Plus, says Kastner, it’s unhealthy to fund one area and not the rest. “Different sciences reinforce each other and the scientific enterprise cannot do well if only one field is supported and the others are not.”"}

In some form, the current debate began in the early 1990s, but has achieved a new urgency in the last several years. Congress has debated significant legislative changes to immigration policy in 2005, 2006, and 2007, but these debates ended inconclusively which had the effect of raising even more the salience of immigration as a policy issue in the public’s mind. Congress will likely again debate immigration reform in 2009.  Our goal in this class is to analyze what it will take for Congress to craft a “comprehensive” immigration reform. Although the need for comprehensive reform is debated (the status quo works for many in the society), the high level of popular dissatisfaction with current policies, the pressures put on the nation by demands for immigrant labor, and the high number of unauthorized migrants resident in the United States demonstrate the need for a thorough review of current policies."}

Revolutionary changes in biological sciences—specifically, in molecular biology and genomics—have given scientists the means to understand and control both the building blocks and larger systems of living things. Now, says Lauffenburger, the “operation of biological functions needs to be understood in terms of biomolecular machines.” But the hard part, he says, is “predicting what happens when you manipulate them. It’s almost trial and error. That’s where engineering comes in.”    Linda Griffith provides one paradigm for such research. She is designing a scaffold on which to grow human cells for use in tissue implants. Using a “computer controlled process that builds complex 3D objects up from scratch,” Griffith creates a device that mimics the complex structures of joints and other body parts – suited for joint repair, or bone regeneration. Her research might someday produce organs for transplant. But Griffith’s grander goal involves “putting surgeons out of business,” by eliminating transplants altogether. She’s building a “liver on a chip” – growing liver cells on a tiny wafer with the architecture and molecular properties of actual liver cells. This biomechanical product can be used to test drug toxicity and gene therapies, and perhaps someday to model and block the growth of cancers.    Angela Belcher models her bioengineered devices on some of nature’s most ingenious products, such as the incredibly strong and exquisitely structured abalone shell. She designs on a nanoscale, getting viruses and antibodies to work with inorganic materials. “How far can you push organisms?” Belcher wonders. To date, she’s taught a nontoxic virus to recognize a specific metal used in a semiconductor wafer. Someday viruses could detect atomic defects in electronics. Belcher also describes virus scaffolds for growing semiconductor wires, and for generating lightweight batteries woven into soldier’s uniforms. She’s even looking into ways of spinning viruses, as spiders spin silk, for generating optical materials."}

The goal of this seminar is to explore the role of science and scientists in ecosystems and natural resources management focusing on joint fact finding as a new approach to environmental policy-making. Increasingly scientists and science organizations are confronting a conundrum: Why is science often ignored in important societal decisions even as the call for decisions based on sound science escalates? One reason is that decision-making is often driven by a variety of nonscientific, adversarial, and stakeholder dynamics. Thus, even though science helps inform choices, it is only one of many values and interests considered by each stakeholder. In response to this emerging challenge, scientists, and science agencies such as the U.S. Geological Survey, are embarking upon research that explores the problems of incorporating science into value-laden societal decisions. This research includes designing experiments that will assess the appropriateness of using the new and emerging approach of Joint Fact Finding to address some of the Nation\u0027s most contentious environmental conflicts.

In fact, in some places, it’s downright hopeful, as Rwandan President Paul Kagame  attests. “Our continent is no longer all about violence and disease and human disasters that scarred many African countries in recent decades,” says Kagame. “We are now becoming a continent of opportunities.”    There are those who doubted Rwanda could “constitute a viable state,” says Kagame, but 14 years after bloody genocide and civil war, his country has managed an astonishing revival -- enough “stability and resilience to allow the economy to grow at an average 7% annually in the past several years.” Other African nations have been expanding at the same pace; oil producers are zooming along at even faster clips. Kagame attributes this recovery to such factors as the “leapfrogging power of mobile technology,” where hundreds of millions of new cell phone users, even in remote areas without electricity, drive the growth of new business. And the number of internet subscribers in Africa is growing more than three times as fast as the rest of the world, says Kagame.    Cell phones and the internet allow Rwandan and other micro entrepreneurs to develop business networks. Kagame describes how technology helped a Kigali bakery expand beyond its neighborhood to reach more customers and suppliers, enabling workers to move into larger homes. In Kenya, Kagame recounts, a new agricultural commodity exchange “has reduced barriers between farmers, traders and consumers,” with the internet and cell phone text messages providing timely market information. This network has improved the incomes of farm families by 25%, leading to better healthcare and education. Rwanda’s power utility is also reaping the benefits of technology, keeping track of customers and accounts more efficiently, and no longer relying on government handouts.    But while technology has enabled Africans “to leapfrog some features of underdevelopment,” Kagame says it is not enough. “Our vision of becoming a middle income country by 2020 … requires thinking and acting inventively, boldly and creatively.” Kagame wants to build a foundation not just in technology but in science. Doing this requires a heavy investment in all levels of education. “Without a knowledge base,” he says, “Africa’s imperative for agricultural and industrial development to create wealth will remain unrealized.” He calls for members of the MIT community to join “in overcoming our challenges and turning them into rewarding opportunities.”"}

Whereas commercial state-of-the-art superconducting magnets reach magnetic fields up to 23 T, higher fields are only available at a small number of specialized large-scale facilities. In Europe there are three major high field laboratories providing access for external users: HLD Dresden, HFML Nijmegen and LNCMI Grenoble-Toulouse, recently united in the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL). First, we will present the infrastructure of the Grenoble EMFL laboratory and its available experimental techniques. Second, we will focus on very high field solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), a powerful microscopic method for investigating many problems in physics, chemistry and materials science. Recently, the options for NMR at Grenoble have been extended to very high magnetic fields (35 T) and frequencies (1.5 GHz), to very low temperatures (50 mK) as well as towards enhanced sensitivity and resolution (10 ppm). Using selected recent research projects we will demonstrate the potential of the available NMR instrumentation."}

Can you do it while stopping in each city only once? Even a supercomputer working at 1 trillion operations per second would take longer than the age of the universe to find a solution when considering each possibility in turn. In 1994, Leonard Adleman published a paper in which he described a solution, using the tools of molecular biology, for a smaller 7-city example of this problem. His paper generated enormous scientific and public interest, and kick-started the field of Biological Computing, the main subject of this discussion based seminar course. Students will analyze the Adleman paper, and the papers that preceded and followed it, with an eye for identifying the engineering and scientific aspects of each paper, emphasizing the interplay of these two approaches in the field of Biological Computing. This course is appropriate for both biology and non-biology majors. Care will be taken to fill in any knowledge gaps for both scientists and engineers.This course is one of manyÃ‚Â Advanced Undergraduate Seminars offered by the Biology Department at MIT.

To start with, I will cover how density-functional calculations may pave the way to purely theoretical (first-principles) Gibbs energy data for solids, very much needed to understand and optimize materials of practical interest, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. Such theoretical approaches are also extremely useful when it comes to pre-dicting non-existent compounds of – at the present time – purely academic interest, nicely ex-emplified by high-pressure metal pernitrides, still a very young class of solid-state phases. Likewise, so-called carbodiimides are the nitrogen-analogues of the well-known oxides be-cause here the oxide anion has been replaced by the isolobal carbodiimide anion, very much in the spirit of a “divalent nitride” species; note that such phases have also been made possible only by theoretical reasoning. The entire series of the transition-metal carbodiimides (as op-posed to the chemically less interesting oxides) exhibits unexpected properties such as ferro-magnetism and spin-liquid-like behavior. Finally, salt-like compounds containing the guani-dine species, a biochemically extremely important building block, have recently been predicted and synthesized, and they correspond to the nitrogen analogues of the well-known carbonates. It is clear that the crystal structures of the guanidinates heavily depend on the H-bond network, which often demands theoretical insight from first-principles computations."}

Her father began the business during the Depression, with the ambition of “building a company to last.” He ruled with what she describes as a “command and control” style. As the company moved into the travel and hotel business following World War II, her father organized the different divisions to compete against each other. After 50 years, he relinquished the company to his daughter—a “pretty innovative” decision, she calls it.  Carlson Nelson determined that the challenge of taking the company global required diverging both from his management style and organizational structure. “I told people we were going to be more democratic, consensual and collaborative. Some people thought, ‘Ah-hah, this is predictable, it’s a woman.’” But she believed the business model and corporate culture had to change. “We would remain stewards of financial capital, but we had to add stewardship of human capital.”  She emphasized integrity and loyalty among managers and interdependence among divisions. Above all, she stressed “respect for the long-term,” so that profits never outweighed sustaining human or natural resources. Carlson Nelson came to believe there could be a “positive application of business in addressing problems of the world.”  Her values seem to have taken hold. When the World Trade Center towers fell on 9/11, a nearby hotel manager turned his ballroom into a rescue station. And more recently, the manager of one T.G.I.Friday’s restaurant hit by Hurricane Katrina rigged up a truck engine to keep the restaurant’s refrigerators running, and served up food and drink to desperate citizens."}

The Bush Administration, he claims, has determined to convert these challenges into opportunities through its proposed energy initiatives. Bodman says, “America must do what it has always done best. We have to take risks: lead, invent and innovate.”  The Bush Administration has shifted funds and priorities to press ahead with programs to develop, among other things, energy from biomass, new coal technology and safer nuclear power plants. It also pledges to fund increased research in high energy and nuclear physics. And while the hope is that this multibillion dollar set of programs will help create clean, domestic energy sources to power autos and industry, Bodman says he “expects more from basic science research than new knowledge alone.”  Bodman has “vivid memories of standing in my backyard in Illinois and making out the (Sputnik) satellite over head. I remember Khrushchev saying he would bury us. It was a time of fear to be sure—of Russian capabilities and of falling behind.” He sees striking parallels to today, with our country confronting obstacles to its security and economic health and wellbeing. Just as the Cold War spurred the space race and tremendous growth in the sciences, with attendant economic benefits, so must today’s increasingly competitive world fuel U.S. efforts “to maintain our scientific and technical superiority,” which he hopes will serve as the economic drivers of the future."}

Many complex systems tend to be selfsimilar  across levels—the same dynamics work at multiple levels. They are explained by scaling  laws. Scalability results from what Mandelbrot calls fractal geometry. A cauliflower is an obvious  example. Fractals often show Pareto distributions and are signified by power laws. Researchers  find organization-related power laws in intrafirm decisions, consumer sales, salaries, size of firms,  movie profits, director interlocks, biotech networks, and industrial districts, for example. Power  laws signify Pareto distributions, which show “fat tails,” (nearly) infinite variance, unstable means,  and unstable confidence intervals. Pareto distributions are alien to most quantitative organizational  researchers, who are trained in Gaussian statistics and are trained to go to great lengths to  configure their data to fit the requirements of linear regression, normal distributions, and related  statistical methods. While normal distributions, and related current quantitative methods are  still relevant for a significant portion of organizational research, power laws signify that Pareto  distributions, fractals, and underlying scale-free theories are increasingly pervasive and valid characterizations  of organizational dynamics. Where true, researchers ignoring power law effects risk  drawing false conclusions and promulgating useless advice to practitioners. This because what  is important to most managers are the extremes they face, not the averages. The implications  for organization science, however, go beyond extreme events. Tools do not exist in a theoretical  vacuum. The adoption of normal distribution statistics carries a heavy baggage of assumptions.  Reliance on linearity, randomness, gradualism, and equilibrium influences how theories are built,  how legitimacy is conferred, and how research questions are formulated. We begin with findings  about 80 kinds of power laws. Then, we present sixteen scale-free theories that apply to organizations.  Next, we discuss research implications. Then, we discuss implications in terms of the basic  predictor function, y \u003d f(x) + ?. How does basic thinking about prediction, data, statistics, and  the error term have to change?"}

The paper combines a cultural and an institutional perspective. It is argued that institutions like the University are based on, and reproduce, expectations towards the behaviour of individuals. In many European Universities, particularly also in Western Europe, the traditional expectations in relation to the main qualifications and the behaviour of an University professor were traditionally mainly also based on two cultural constructions: * on the image of the male breadwinner who is comprehensively available for his profession, while another person takes over the organisation of his everyday life, as well as housework and childcare; * on a ‘male ‘habitus (according to Bourdieu 1987): this means, that specific qualities that the professor is expected to have are in society defined as ‘male’ qualities. However, together with a fundamental change of European universities in the last fifteen years that can be called an ‘economisation’ of Universities, also the cultural ideal of the University professor, and the expectations which are connected with this position, have in part fundamentally changed. Such change has in part already started earlier in East European countries than in the West. It is argued here that this development has opened new options for women for a University career. However, there are considerable cross-national differences with respect to the chances for women to make a University career in Nanosciences. It is argued that particularly also some cultural factors contribute to explaining such differences: the respective cultural model of the University professor in a society , the societal esteem that is connected with this position, and the way in which “care” is constructed in the dominant cultural model of the family."}

In fact, Ram Sasisekharan remembers how colleagues told him “not to work on carbohydrates -- that it was useless.” But his research has shown that glycans, observed as long chains or intricate branches of sugars on the surface of all cells, are significant players in the complex drama of cell growth, migration and death. Tracking down the function of sugars from their structure has turned out to be trickier than determining what protein a segment of DNA codes for. Sasisekharan likens it to “image processing, with six blind men and an elephant.” His team, deploying diverse analysis techniques, learned that sugars affect such properties of proteins as the ways in which they fold. Sasisekharan has also discovered that tumor cells contain sugar sequences that keep tumors dormant, or signal them to start dividing. He has found that pathogens such as viruses and bacteria bind to glycans. This opens the possibility for using glycans in subtle diagnostics as well as for “novel drug delivery strategies.”    Martha Gray provides some vignettes from the Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST), demonstrating stunning advances in medical engineering. Leaping beyond RotoRooter methods for treating plugged blood vessels, HST researchers have developed stents for opening arteries that deliver drugs and function longer. And in a major breakthrough, scientists have managed to produce a polymer seeded with rat heart cells, and stimulate this living tissue to beat the way actual heart muscle does. Gray’s own research involves arthritis, and she describes new imaging techniques “that allow you to see things you didn’t see before,” including tiny defects in cartilage that may predict the emergence of joint disease."}

Margaret Leinen, drawing on the U.N.’s recent climate reports, and the latest research from the field, shows the dire graph: a red line of CO2 emissions marching steadily upward, with accompanying graphics depicting hoped-for impacts of international efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas release.  The current global abatement “wedges” consist of technologies not yet developed or widely deployed, such as energy efficiencies, cellulosic biofuels, solar, wind, and nuclear. Leinen notes that most of the abatement in renewables “comes into play 20-30 years out,” and the “reality is there will be increases in CO2 in the atmosphere for the next 20-30 years while we try to address the problem.” Policy makers have not begun to grapple with the notion of delayed onset of emissions, says Leinen. Among scientists, there’s growing concern that “we’re going to be dealing with catch-up for a long enough time that we will suffer the consequences of emissions regardless of whether we put policies in place.”  These projections suggest to some scientists that we must take more radical, immediate steps and geoengineer our way out of global warming. But other scientists, says Leinen, are loath to discuss these approaches, much less let them see the light of day. Carbon capture and sequestration, “viewed as necessary mechanisms for emissions reductions by some” says Leinen, and which have captured the interest of politicians, are viewed by another scientific camp “as soft engineering, or geoengineering light.” When a Nobel scientist wrote an article proposing the use of stratospheric aerosols to decrease sunlight hitting the earth, alarmed scientists lobbied prestigious journals not to publish it. Leinen’s own area of research, ocean iron fertilization, attempts to stimulate phytoplankton activity, which would help sop up atmospheric CO2. These approaches all face opposition because of their possible, negative impacts. But, says Leinen, these arguments “ignore the fact that we’re faced with a situation in which we must have an entire portfolio of activities” for reducing CO2. She worries that lack of discourse, or constant dispute will put scientists in a position “where policy makers want to move to (the new) techniques … and we won’t have studied them sufficiently to provide good scientific answers about whether they work.”"}

It presents an overview of observed changes in the climate system and their relationships with physical processes as well as an overview of projections for future climate changes. \\\"Global warming\\\" does not imply uniform, gradual nor possibly benign changes in global climate. As Earth is getting hotter, observed changes are non-uniform, rapid and harmful. Global climatic disruption is real without doubt; mainly human-caused; already producing significant harm; and growing more rapidly than expected. What climate change puts at risk? First the availability of water, productivity of farms, forests, fisheries, secondly damages from storms, floods, droughts, wildfires and property losses from sea-level rise, expenditures on engineered environments and distribution and abundance of species. Facing the dangers from climate change there are only three options for human society. First is mitigation, meaning measures to reduce the pace and magnitude of the changes in global climate being caused by human activities. The second is adaptation, meaning measures to reduce the adverse impacts on human well-being resulting from the changes in climate that do occur. And the third is suffering the adverse impacts that are not avoided by either mitigation or adaptation. We\u0027re already doing some of each. Minimizing the amount of suffering in that mix can only be achieved by doing a lot of mitigation and a lot of adaptation."}

This physician turned biochemist has held distinguished positions at the National Institutes of Health, Merck, and now at MIT, but common themes unite his pursuits: “I’m always excited by the inherent beauty of molecular and biochemical insights into how biology works. Making scientific discoveries for me is tremendously emotionally satisfying and in fact addicting.”    In his talk, Scolnick touches on such research breakthroughs as identifying virus oncogenes, and developing treatments for cardiovascular disease, Hepatitis B, and osteoporosis, among others. He emphasizes that teasing out the biochemistry of diseases is “the key to success in drug discovery.” In Marfan syndrome, for example, investigators learned that a mutant gene leads to a malfunctioning aorta. Finding a cure flowed from understanding the underlying pathological processes. Scolnick proudly describes research on a gene involved with cholesterol buildup and an elevated risk for cardiovascular disease. This led to the development of statins, which has helped dramatically reduce the death rate in people with heart disease.    Scolnick offers a dramatic chronology of his pioneering work at Merck starting in 1981 to find an effective AIDS treatment, an effort leading to the protease inhibitor Crixivan. His timeline covers more than a decade of scientific collaboration to block the mechanism of HIV, and involves false starts, the death of a key scientist in the Lockerbie bombing, pressure from AIDS activists and corporate overseers, a “miracle” AIDS patient, breakthroughs in measuring viral protein, and more than one “twist of fate.”    In 2004, Scolnick turned in a new direction: toward mental illness, a field stalled for decades due to ignorance “about the underlying biochemistry and physiology of the disease.” Today, with the help of genomics and computative technologies, researchers are beginning to reveal the basic genetic architecture of schizophrenia and bipolar illness, says Scolnick. The “outline of their biochemistry” is starting to come clear for the first time, leading to the real possibility of novel therapeutics. While the challenges are formidable, he believes, consolidating MIT’s “first rate neuroscience, human genetics, chemistry (creates) a unique opportunity to do something in a field that desperately needs the kind of approach and change we were able to bring to the AIDS field.”    NOTE: Audio levels for Kastner and Horvitz are very low, but improve when Scolnick begins his talk. We apologize for the inferior audio capture in the field."}

It was Sakharov, Gottfried reminds us, who in recent times forged a powerful connection between science and politics: just as science relies on objective truths which can only be arrived at through testing of hypotheses, a democratic consensus depends on public study and open discussion of facts and beliefs. But, Gottfried warns, our nation is rapidly “moving away from a reality-based conception of policy and culture” and if our “policies relentless ignore reality, they will collide with it.” Behind this slide toward unreality, he says, is the government’s “distortion of scientific knowledge in advocating its policies to the public and Congress.” Among a long list of examples: the systematic misrepresentation of the scientific consensus about climate change; political litmus tests for scientific advisory committees; abolishing advisory committees on nuclear deregulation; and posting misinformation on government websites about a condoms and spurious links between breast cancer and abortion. Says Gottfried, “Some of these cases are reminiscent of Soviet-era practices.” He warns that there’s a limit to how long you can stay out of contact with reality.”  In her response, Sheila Jasanoff urges scientists to join hands with experts from other disciplines to serve as watchdogs on issues of science and technology. She says that “human rights provides a wonderful umbrella” for such an effort. Jasanoff makes a clear distinction between the practice of ‘regulatory science,’ which is more politicized from the get-go, and research science. She argues for public debate on the values that lie behind policy-making, and to “hold politics answerable to public hopes, fears, beliefs, knowledge, desire and needs.”"}
{"courseProvider":"VideoLectures.net","courseLink":"http://www.ocwconsortium.org/courses/view/21aaebb169243a7dc86666784e53ccf0/","name":"Narratives of Science","desc":"Robert Kanigel poses the central question of this panel: “The storytelling express is leaving the station. Do we want to jump aboard, or under some circumstances, stay where we are?” Science writing has matured as a discipline and genre, and for many writers, this means telling a story with what Kanigel describes as “a narrative arc: a cannon propelling you through a text, because of readers’ eagerness to know what’s happening next.” This implies some kind of linear movement, whether the writer focuses on “the smallest atomic unit” or a larger canvas. But Kanigel wonders if “there are circumstances when we don’t want stories.”  Thomas Levenson responds, “You can go a long way down the path of understanding science as a human activity without getting a story.” He offers the example of a writer who keeps a diary of a year spent in a laboratory -- what Levenson describes as “science travelogues.” But from his early experiences as a journalist, Levenson has found that “Science produces a certain kind of knowledge, but the activity of science takes shape within and is shaped by the world beyond science.” So he brings an historical, interpretative method to bear on his subjects, including Einstein. Says Levenson, “You get to make meaning out of the story you want rather than asking people to extract meaning out of a happenstance of facts.”  Alan Lightman ponders the role of science in novels, theatre and film. He offers several examples of “gripping and suspenseful” discussions of science within narratives, such as Michael Ondaatje’s novel, The English Patient and Michael Frayn’s play, Copenhagen. These authors avoid the didactic with a “motor that drives us through discussion.” But the very popular genre of science biography proves trickier to propel successfully. “In science, it’s more of a challenge to intertwine work with life because life deals with the inanimate,” says Lightman."}

We further focus   on two types of 2D, dimer, spin systems, which give raise to very different   ground states under an applied magnetic field. One example is the   \\\"Shastry-Sutherland\\\" compound SrCu2(BO3)2, which exhibits magnetization   plateaus at fractional values of the saturation magnetization. In this   compound plateaus appear because the kinetic energy of the triplet   excitations is strongly reduced by frustration, so that the triplets can   crystallize into a commensurate super-lattice. NMR signature of such a   super-lattice in the 1/8 magnetization plateau of SrCu2(BO3)2 is a unique   observation of this type of magnetization plateau created by spontaneous   breaking of translational symmetry [1]. We shall also discuss some new   results on the magnetic ground states at fields above the 1/8 plateau (i.e.   above 28.4 T), which seemed to be a candidate for a supersolid phase.   Another type of 2D spin system is represented by the so-called \\\"Han purple\\\"   compound, BaCuSi2O6, for which there is no magnetic frustration, and in   which a (2D) Bose-Einstein condensation of triplet excitations occurs above   23.35 T. We shall present a microscopic picture of this complicated high   field phase, in which NMR data reveal that the average boson density in the   condensate is strongly modulated along the direction perpendicular to the 2D   planes, with a density ratio for every second plane nA/nB"}

The course will review the historical role of national science policy in addressing the health, welfare, and security needs of the nation, and will provide an organizational map to help the reader better understand how the federal government develops and executes its science policy and why it funds science. It will explore how universities, national laboratories, and industry partner with the federal government to carry out scientific research, and why states are developing their own scientific and technological support structures. The course will examine the interactions between the scientific community and policymakers, and the grand challenges that face science and society, including environmental preservation, advances in new technologies, transportation, power generation, and prevention and cure of diseases. The urgency of strengthening these interactions in order to meet such significant scientific and technical challenges will be explored. The course is intended for a broad spectrum of upper division undergraduate students, both from science-based and non-science majors.\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp variable\u003d\\\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/variable#\\\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrimary Instructor\u003c/strong\u003e: Homer A Neal\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInstructor\u003c/strong\u003e: James J Duderstadt\u003c/p\u003e \u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAvailable on:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003ca href\u003d\\\"http://lecb.physics.lsa.umich.edu/CWIS/SPT--BrowseResources.php?ParentId\u003d313\\\"\u003eCARMA\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e \u003cfieldset class\u003d\\\"fieldgroup group-instructor\\\"\u003e\u003clegend\u003eInstructor\u003c/legend\u003e\u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field field-type-nodereference field-field-course-instructor\\\"\u003e       \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-label\\\"\u003eCourse Instructor:\u0026nbsp;\u003c/div\u003e     \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-items\\\"\u003e             \u003cdiv class\u003d\\\"field-item odd\\\"\u003e                     \u003ca href\u003d\\\"http://open.umich.edu/instructor/homer-neal\\\"\u003eHomer A.

In many cases they draw inspiration from biology, which provides innumerable examples of systems that cope with complexity. From cells to ecosystems, biology achieves scalability, adaptability, self-repair, and robustness, often by exploiting \\\"emergent\\\" system-level behaviours. Achieving equivalent success in engineered systems is the root problem that we face.\\ In the first of our short courses, we introduce the core concepts of complexity in the context of both natural and engineered systems, and explore the ways in which new computational systems, models, and simulations are taking part in complexity science through a series of lectures and workshop activities."}

The SELEX method consists of iterative cycles of in vitro screening of a combinatorial oligonucleotide library containing to 1016 different molecules and possible secondary and tertiary structures for target binding followed by PCR amplification of selected sequences. Aptamer ligands can be developed against almost any target protein. Due to the wide spectrum of applications, these novel molecules are used in numerous pharmacological, clinical and industrial processes. In the beginning, RNA and DNA aptamers were identified which bind to proteins that naturally interact with nucleic acids or small molecules such as ATP. In the following years, the use of the SELEX technique was extended in order to isolate oligonucleotide ligands for a wide range of proteins of importance for therapy and diagnostics, such as growth factors (3), cell surface antigens, entire cells and even whole organisms. Recently, the use of in vitro selection methods have been extended to living organisms such as bacteria, trypanosomes and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. Moreover, since it became apparent that aptamers are capable to distinguish between little differences in cell surface-marker-proteins expressed by i.e. cancer cells, parasite-infected cells or stem cells in comparison to normal somatic cell, they have been developed into promising agents for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In this talk, I will focus on new accomplishments of the aptamer technology, and demonstrate some examples from my own research."}

What influences consumer and voter preferences? How does participation in social systems affect behaviors such as fraud, technology adoption, or resource allocation? Often for the first time, these questions are being examined by analyzing massive data sets that record the behavior and interactions of individuals in physical and virtual worlds.    A new kind of scientific endeavor - computational social science - is emerging at the intersection of social science and computer science. The field draws from a rich base of existing theory from psychology, sociology, economics, and other social sciences, as well as from the formal languages and algorithms of computer science. The result is an unprecedented opportunity to revolutionize the social sciences, expand the reach and impact of computer science, and enable decision-makers to understand the complex systems and social interactions that we must manage in order to address fundamental challenges of economic welfare, energy production, sustainability, health care, education, and crime.    Computational social science suggests an impressive array of new tasks and technical challenges to researchers and practitioners of KDD. These include modeling complex systems with temporal, spatial, and relational dependence; identifying cause and effect rather than mere association; modeling systems with feedback; and conducting analyses in ways that protect the privacy of individuals. Many of these challenges interact in fundamental ways that are both surprising and encouraging. Together, they point to an exciting new future for knowledge discovery and data mining. "}

In microscopy, this causes a shift from pure presentation of \\\"supporting cases\\\" toward the quantification of the processes under study. Computer image processing breaks through the light microcopy diffraction limit, it allows to track individual molecules in the life specimen, quantify distribution and co-localization of compartment markers, etc. The quantified experimental data forms a basis for the models of the biological processes. Quality of predictive models is crucially dependent on the accuracy of the quantified experimental data. The quality of experimental data is a function of algorithms as well as the imperfections of the \\\"wet\\\" experiment. The number of research papers devoted to the algorithms of microcopy image analysis, segmentation, classification and tracking has grown very fast in the last two decades. The analysis of the source of noise in \\\"wet\\\" biology and microscopy has gotten less attention. In this talk I will focus on the correction of experimental data before applying analysis algorithms. These corrections have two faces. They are obligatory to compensate for imperfections of \\\"wet\\\" microscopy while at the same time this correction can break some assumptions, which form the basis of algorithms for subsequent analysis.

According to David Botstein, the answer lies in “educating the biologist of the 21st century”—someone who will be conversant not just with molecular biology, but with computer science, physics and chemistry. At Princeton’s new Lewis-Sigler Institute, Botstein is spearheading an innovative effort at interdisciplinary undergraduate education. Students will take advantage of state of the art laboratories and computers capable of crunching vast amounts of data generated by actual research. Professors will “provide essential fundamental concepts as required, using the just-in-time-principle”-- no more of the “learn this now, it will be good for you later” approach, which Botstein likens to hazing. Botstein says there is “lots of overhead in teaching historical and traditional origins” so his students will learn instead “with ideas and technologies of today.” He wants to create a new basic language that will enable his biology students to make sense of the fundamental issues of other disciplines."}

Today, he is no longer straddling the line, and indeed, has amassed forceful evidence that post-industrial society has brought about enormous change in earth systems, and may cause irreparable damage as this century progresses.  Prinn provides a short lesson on radiative forcing -- the process by which the earth absorbs solar radiation and gives off energy by emitting infrared radiation. These processes, which should be in balance, increasingly are not, due to manmade activities that trap the heat from the sun, and drive up the earth’s temperature. Prinn comes armed with MIT’s Integrated Global System Model, which helps show how human industry, agriculture and consumption feed into the delicate, interconnected physical and biological workings of atmosphere, ocean and earth. Forecasting the climate into the future, says Prinn, “is no longer a job for the natural sciences, but for a combination of natural and social sciences.”  Prinn’s illustrations depicting how human activity and earth systems interact are almost comically complex, and he acknowledges that his models must take into account major uncertainties. Clouds, ocean mixing and aerosols act as wild cards in terms of radiative forcing. However, observation of earth’s climate over millennia, and the running of computer simulations hundreds of times, have yielded some probabilities that Prinn believes policy makers must contend with.  Even assuming that civilization can limit its carbon dioxide emissions to twice preindustrial levels (550 parts per million), some very dramatic shifts will happen (or have already begun): the poles will heat up much faster than other parts of the world, melting ice and raising sea levels. Arctic tundra and soil will thaw and release methane, a much more potent greenhouse gas even than carbon dioxide. Another possibility: The ocean will reach its limit in absorbing atmospheric CO2, and, to put it bluntly, begin to die.  There are things we can and should do, says Prinn, if we want to avoid playing roulette with life on earth, and these actions are not priced beyond our means. We can make our transportation and building energy costs more efficient. We can continue to use coal if we figure out how to capture and store carbon underground. We’ll need to develop biofuels. Bills in Congress seeking to achieve 50-80% reductions in carbon emissions below 1990 levels won’t cripple our economy, Prinn’s models show. “Bottom line, we can afford this.”"}

Razlogi, zakaj ni bolj razvito, so povezani s tematiko sámo.  Evolucijska biologija zahteva perspektivo, v kateri se kulturno vedenje razvije kot specifi?na  prilagoditev. Vedenjski ekologi na terenu pa si prizadevajo razlo?iti kulturno vedenje od togo okoljsko  in gensko dolo?enega. Zato zahtevajo širšo definicijo kulture od tiste, ki so jo prevzeli od  družboslovja.

But it has not happened. The reasons have to do with the topic itself. Evolutionary biology demands a research perspective where culture is viewed as a special kind of adaptation. Behavioral ecologists, on the other hand, try to unravel cultural behavior from environmentally and genetically fixed behavioral patterns. They feel they need a broader definition of culture from the one taken over from social sciences and humanities. At the same time the research of the remains of our extinct ancestors and relatives is still motivated by the wish to recognize distinctly human behavioral patterns. These practices are being questioned in the text. As culture ceased functioning as an operative concept in social sciences and humanities, it is argued that the collaboration between natural sciences and social sciences with humanities would be better if problems of biology would be held distinct from humanist presuppostions."}

If you ran the program long enough, it would reproduce every single thing that happens. It’s not out of the question, according to Wolfram’s lecture which somehow encapsulates his 1,200-page opus, A New Kind of Science, in a single hour.  Wolfram’s vast and penetrating research uses simple computations to generate complex computer models that resemble designs found in nature. He embraces the really big subjects, and the really small ones—from patterns on mollusk shells and the shapes of leaves and snowflakes, to free will, evolution, and extra-terrestrial life. This new kind of thinking might provide alternatives to evolution in explaining how different forms of life emerged. Wolfram believes his work is already transforming the study of science, as well as making possible a host of new technologies."}

Managing the resultant complexity is becoming the central challenge for UK industry and government: from software, to cities and even stock exchanges. Across the UK, a wide range of internationally leading research groups are addressing this challenge. In many cases they draw inspiration from biology, which provides innumerable examples of systems that cope with complexity. From cells to ecosystems, biology achieves scalability, adaptability, self-repair, and robustness, often by exploiting \\\"emergent\\\" system-level behaviours. Achieving equivalent success in engineered systems is the root problem that we face.\\ In the first of our short courses, we introduce the core concepts of complexity in the context of both natural and engineered systems, and explore the ways in which new computational systems, models, and simulations are taking part in complexity science through a series of lectures and workshop activities."}

The Bush Administration, he claims, has determined to convert these challenges into opportunities through its proposed energy initiatives. Bodman says, “America must do what it has always done best. We have to take risks: lead, invent and innovate.”    The Bush Administration has shifted funds and priorities to press ahead with programs to develop, among other things, energy from biomass, new coal technology and safer nuclear power plants. It also pledges to fund increased research in high energy and nuclear physics. And while the hope is that this multibillion dollar set of programs will help create clean, domestic energy sources to power autos and industry, Bodman says he “expects more from basic science research than new knowledge alone.”    Bodman has “vivid memories of standing in my backyard in Illinois and making out the (Sputnik) satellite over head. I remember Khrushchev saying he would bury us. It was a time of fear to be sure—of Russian capabilities and of falling behind.” He sees striking parallels to today, with our country confronting obstacles to its security and economic health and wellbeing. Just as the Cold War spurred the space race and tremendous growth in the sciences, with attendant economic benefits, so must today’s increasingly competitive world fuel U.S. efforts “to maintain our scientific and technical superiority,” which he hopes will serve as the economic drivers of the future."}

The things we make, including our stories, reflect, serve, and often shape our needs and desires. We see this everywhere from fairy tale to kiddie lit to myth; from \u0026quot;Cinderella\u0026quot; to Alice in Wonderland to Superman; from building a fort as a child to building ideal, planned cities as whole societies. Fantasy in ways both entertaining and practical serves our persistent needs and desires and illuminates the human mind. Fantasy expresses itself in many ways, from the comfort we feel in the godlike powers of a fairy godmother to the seductive unease we feel confronting Dracula. From a practical viewpoint, of all the fictional forms that fantasy takes, science fiction, from Frankenstein to Avatar, is the most important in our modern world because it is the only kind that explicitly recognizes the profound ways in which science and technology, those key products of the human mind, shape not only our world but our very hopes and fears.

Semantic Web technologies have started to make a di?erence in enterprise settings and have begun to creep into use in limited parts of the World Wide Web. As is common in overview articles, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Semantic Web could provide important infrastructure for activities across the broader Internet. Many of these seem to be focused on improvements to what is essentially a search function (e.g., “list the prices of ?at screen HDTVs larger than 40 inches with 1080p resolution at shops in the nearest town that are open until 8pm on Tuesday evenings” [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic Web]), and such capabilities will surely be of use to future Internet users. However, if one looks closely at the research agendas of some of the largest Internet companies, it is not clear that the staples of SW thinking will intersect the most important paths of the major broad-spectrum service providers. Some of the emerging trends in the research labs of key industry players indicate that SW goals generally taken for granted may be less central than envisioned and that the biggest opportunities may come from some less obvious directions. Given the level of investment and the global reach of big players like Yahoo!  and Google, it would pay us to look more closely at some of their fundamental investigations.      While not all companies see the future in the same way, there are some trends and priorities that are instructive to contemplate. While Web search will continue to play a large role, and services composed from piece-parts o?ered by multiple vendors will be important, some relatively novel ideas may come to dominate. In one view, there will emerge a set of new sciences that are fundamental to future generations of Internet businesses. By understanding the imperatives of those new areas of thought, we may be able to get a better assessment of the true ultimate impact of SW technologies on the broader Internet. At the very least, framing future Semantic Web directions and examples in terms more aligned with some of these ideas may encourage more attention from some of the major  Internet companies, which to date have shown only lukewarm interest.    Search will continue to play a signi?cant role for users of the Internet. While from a user’s perspective the most essential thing is the ability to ?nd a website or document or element of data relevant to a task at hand, it is critical to the service provider that, in addition to producing relevant results, it be able to expose the user to advertisements well-suited to his or her immediate and longer-term needs and interests. While not restricted to search settings, high-quality matching of ads is critical to the continued success and growth of the major  Internet search and content providers. In the long run, a better understanding of users in general and customers in speci?c is essential to providing a better experience and providing better opportunities through advertising. This is an area where a huge amount of investment is being made. Does it provide any interesting opportunities for SW technology?"}

His talk was one of a series of public lectures organized by Robert Hutchins, then the chancellor of the university. The list of speakers is impressive, and included Frank Lloyd Wright, Arnold Schoenberg, and Marc Chagall. That list proves two things. It shows that Hutchins was an impresario with remarkable powers of persuasion, and that he already recognized Chandra as a world-class artist whose medium happened to be theories of the universe rather than music or paint. I say “Chandra” because that is the name his friends used for him when he was alive."}

These are the methods for discovering new knowledge or generating new hypotheses that may lead to knowledge. The data that we are analysing manly arise from research, but also from routine practice in medicine. In the recent years, we are paying special attention to methods for generating hypotheses from bibliographic data. We are also cautiously expanding the scope of our research, presently into the field of electric stimulation of smooth muscles and associated electromiography. In brief, our research can be divided into three sub-fields:    # Biostatistics  # Scientometrics  # Data mining in v bibliographic databases    The focus of our research in biostatistics is on regression models for survival analysis, especially the Cox model. In addition to explained variation, prognostic value and frailties, which have so far been our main topics related to the Cox model, we will concentrate our efforts on time-varying coefficients and testing specific alternative hypotheses, such as crossing hazards, during the forthcomming five-year period. The presently available tests do not distinguish the later situations from the null hypothesis. Beside the Cox model, we will continue studying intensely the field of relative survival, where we have recently developed an entirely new method.  We will also extend the scope of our research outside survival analysis. We will investigate the methods for assessing goodness-of-fit of the logistic regression model. The present approaches are based on unit grouping, which has several disadvantages. Our approach will be based on application of results from the theory of stochastic processes, especially Brownian motion.    Research in scientometrics is relatively new in general, while it is virtually nonexistent in Slovenia. It is almost impossible to conduct such research without an adequate bibliographic database, so the Biomedicina Slovenica is of fundamental importance for us. Another indispensable tool is a system for automated citation analysis, which we have also developed. The third key factor is selection of appropriate indicators, which has also been a field of our experiseje for a number of years. It is only the combination of these three components that gives one with the possibility to work on research evaluation, even though the methodological problems do not end there. Namely, all the various bibliographic databases are organised in a way that prevents the usage of standard data-analytic approaches. Hence, we have developed a system based on OLAP (On Line Analytical Processing) methodology that transforms data from bibliographic databases into a multidimensional orthogonal structure, which can then be analysed by means of the usual (statistical) methods. Two of our staff recently published an article on this in Scientometrics, the leading journal in the field. During the next five years, we will be mainly interested in research trends in Slovene medicine, as well as the ifluence of the number of authors, inter-institutional co-operation, authors\u0027 citation history and other factors on the impact of publications.    Data mining in bibliographic databases is a novel approach to browsing such databases. So far, we have developed a system for supporting biomedical discovery. The system aids researchers in creating new hypotheses, which can then be tested using the established research methods. Our approach treats hypotheses as relations between biomedical concepts that have not been published in the scientific literature yet.The core of the system is the Medline bibliographic database, which is joined with the LocusLink, HUGO, OMIM and UniGene genetic databases in the present version. This makes the system particularly useful for discovering new relations in the field of genetics, such as predicting candidate genes for a new disease."}

The research is aimed at analyzing the opinions of leading political scientists from relevant Central European universities on the development of the political sciences since 1989, both in their home countries and in the wider context of Central  Europe. The research was based on standard methods for evaluating the dynamics of development of political science as an academic discipline, methods not used in Central Europe until now. The research reveals new information on the following topics: (1) the processes of institutionalization and organization of the political sciences; (2) the degree of (dis)continuity with pre-989 developments, and ongoing re-definitions of the discipline; (3) the configuration of newly-created  communities of political scientists; (5) the paradigms, theories, methods and topics favoured by those academics; and (6) the relationship between academia and broader society. The output of the research is a complex, comparative and structured image of the development of the political sciences in the four Central European countries, studied in the era of renewed academic freedom.

Ramanathan deploys simple but extremely helpful metaphors to describe the processes behind warming. CO2 in the atmosphere, whether manmade or natural, surrounds the earth like a blanket, holding onto the radiation from the sun. When the blanket is behaving properly, enough sun’s heat stays on earth to keep biological forces humming, and the rest escapes back into space. But if this blanket gets thicker, it “prevents the body from losing heat.” CO2 is particularly noxious, since it “lives in the atmosphere for a century if not longer.” But it turns out we have other molecules circling the globe to worry about.  Starting in the 1970s, scientists discovered that compounds in the atmosphere, such as chlorofluorocarbons and methane, acted more powerfully than CO2 in making our “blanket” more efficient in trapping heat. They began developing models trying to describe the complex interplay of heat-trapping gases with earth’s natural climate systems. Ramanathan’s work, which involves precise observations from the surface, satellite measurements, balloons and unmanned vehicles, has convinced him “that climate change is worse than what we get from the models.”  The most recent UN report on climate change predicts that greenhouse gases already in circulation have committed the planet to a warming of 2.5 degrees. “No matter what we do today to reduce emissions, the planet will still heat up,” says Ramanathan. But, through a quirk that Ramanathan has spent 10 years uncovering, the planet actually manifests only ¼ of the warming it should based on these climate models. Air pollution, specifically brown clouds from burning biomass, Ramanathan has learned, act as a global warming mask, reducing sunlight on the ground. “On the one hand, it has protected us, but also prevented us from seeing the full blast of the greenhouse effect,” he says. “One of the dumbest things we can do is to reduce sunlight,” because it reduces ocean evaporation, which cuts down on rainfall, and shifts weather systems everywhere, shrinking harvests and glaciers.  We are left with “Faustian bargains,” says Ramanathan. If we cut airborne pollutants such as sulfur, the mask will drop, temperatures rise rapidly, and climate tipping elements come into play. Curing one ill causes another. Any plan for “dismantling the experiment we have done with blankets, mirrors and dust must be done as carefully as dismantling a nuclear device.”"}

To overcome the limits of traditional materials, new materials concepts are needed. An example is inorganic-organic hybrid materials. Combination of inorganic and organic building blocks on a molecular scale results in properties between that of purely organic (polymers, molecular materials etc.) and purely inorganic materials (glass, ceramics, etc.). In order to obtain the desired “tailor-made” property profiles, the reactivity and functionality of the molecular precursors must be carefully tuned. This offers the opportunity to design chemical strategies for the synthesis of materials with pre-defined properties.  ----\t  Novi materiali so osnova novih tehnologij.

This has  fundamental implications on how we perceive the role of technical systems and in particular  information processing infrastructures for scientific work: They are no longer a subordinate  instrument that facilitates (or makes more miserable) daily work of highly gifted individuals,  but become an essential tool and enabler for performing scientific\f progress, and eventually might  be the instrument within which scientific discoveries are made, represented and brought to use."}

Recurrent images of the poet as an inspired lunatic, and of poetry as a fundamentally irrational art, have often fostered an understanding of poets and their work as generally extraneous to the work of the sciences. Yet poets have long reflected upon and have sought to embody in their work the most elementary processes of mind, and have frequently drawn for these representations on the very sciences to which they are thought to stand - and sometimes do genuinely stand - in opposition. Far from representing a mere departure from reason, then, the poem offers an image of the mind at work, an account of how minds work, a tool for eliciting thought in the reader or auditor. Bringing together readings in British poetry of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries with writings from the emergent sciences of psychology and the physiology of the brain, this interdisciplinary course will explore the ways in which British poets, in years that witnessed the crucial development of these sciences, sought to capture an image of the mind at work. The primary aim of the course is to examine how several prominent genres of British poetry - the lyric, for instance, and the didactic poem - draw from and engage in this period with accounts of cognition within the sciences of psychology, physiology, and medicine. More broadly, the course aims to give undergraduates with some prior experience in the methods and topics of literary study an introduction to interdisciplinary humanistic research."}

But the decision-makers aren\u0027t even seeing the science,\\\" says Knobloch.  The Union of Concerned Scientists has documented an egregious series of cases in which the White House shaped science to conform to its political goals: e.g., at the administration\u0027s request, the Environmental Protection Agency altered a report on climate change; the White House concealed research on the devastating impact of mercury on fetal development while Congress debated legislation dealing with power plant emissions; Cabinet secretaries replaced independent scientists with industry representatives on advisory committees dealing with environmental and public health issues.

Merton, who delves into the dense science of derivatives -- a field he has fundamentally shaped -- to explain how the vast global economic collapse has come about, and how financial innovations at the heart of the collapse could also be tools for reconstruction.  Merton uses deceptively simple graphs to show how risk propagated rapidly across financial networks, bringing down financial institutions. While he admits the crisis “is very big and complicated,” Merton boils a piece of it down to the use of put options, a derivative contract that’s been around since the 17th century. This asset-value insurance contract, a guarantee of debt, is the basis for the credit default swaps widely adopted by financial giants in the last few years -- now widely regarded as a primary cause of the meltdown. It turns out, says Merton, that the put “makes risky debt very complicated, and treacherous…”  In these puts, if the value of assets goes down, the guarantee value goes up, so the value of the written insurance is worth more. The value of this guarantee is very sensitive to the movement of the underlying asset. When dealing with puts on the local level, this movement can be tracked and managed more easily. But when financial institutions manipulate bundles of assets (for instance, mortgage-backed securities), the increase in risk proves non-linear. Add some volatility, like the jolts posed by widespread drops in housing prices, and the difference between the decline in asset value and the value of the guarantee becomes enormous -- leading to mountains of debt and felling behemoths like AIG (insurer to lenders).  Yet, Merton counsels not to blame the current crisis on put options, or too much complexity, but rather on incomplete understanding of the models of risk involved. It’s not “bad and incompetent people” who have brought this about (although he admits there are plenty of those) but “a structural issue between financial innovation and crisis.” We’ve essentially built a high speed train for which there’s not yet an appropriate track. We’ve created instruments for manipulating financial risk without a thorough understanding of the underlying engineering.  Derivatives are not going away, says Merton. We need regulators who understand these instruments, and perhaps a sovereign wealth fund intended to “maximize the expected return for risk for people of the U.S.” Merton concludes with “something positive” -- a model of how to “weaken the tradeoff between pursuing comparative advantage vs. efficient risk,” applied to the nation of Taiwan."}

The basic principle underlying our current economy is “to make rich people happy and make everybody else frightened.” Chomsky lays particular blame for this doctrine on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan-- “Saint Alan”-- who claims the economy is working well because of private entrepreneurial initiative and expanding consumer choice. Chomsky disagrees. He claims that in the last 30 years, it has been public spending on such technologies as computers, satellites, the Internet and lasers that has fed the economy. And the wealth derived from these technologies has gone primarily into the hands of corporate masters, who represent a fraction of the American people. The government has used a succession of bogeymen—the Soviets, Communist insurgents around the world, and now global terrorism—to scare taxpayers into supporting core defense programs whose technologies ultimately spin off into private hands. The current administration advocates not merely controlling space, but owning it, with a new missile-based system and satellite-guided unmanned drones.

Much of this digital technology now permeates everyday life. Building on these and emerging technologies, the 21st century is poised to unleash a new, data-intensive paradigm of scientific discovery that will dramatically enhance the scope and scale of data capture, curation, and analysis. In this new (4th) paradigm, cures for cancer might be found by the collective investigations of agents computing \u0026quot;in the cloud.\u0026rdquo;\u003cbr /\u003e \u0026nbsp;\u003cbr /\u003e This course will invite students to explore the social and technical development of computing for the sciences, from the ENIAC through the top-500 list of supercomputers and on to Amazon\u0027s EC2.

Much more time is spent gathering, integrating and preparing the data for analysis. Still, many data analysis tools focus on the analytical parts only. In this talk we will present the core technology behind KNIME, an open source integration and analysis platform. In addition to offering comprehensive built-in ETL, analysis and visualization methods, KNIME\u0027s open API facilitates the integration of other tools. The underlying modular architecture enables a coherent and transparent fusion of the diverse data sources spread out over the corporate IT environment, while at the same time integrating existing legacy tools and other data processing and analysis methods. We will show real-world examples of KNIME being successfully deployed as an integration and analysis backbone and how it can be used to quickly deploy new science, e.g. new methods for the analysis and exploration of data at the same time. We will also take the time to provide a brief overview of how the graphical, modular representation of a data workflow enables complex data processing and analysis procedures to be documented, archived and communicated."}

Web Science is inherently inter-disciplinary. Web Science research aims to provide the means to better model the Web’s structure, describe the principles that have fuelled its phenomenal growth, and discover how online human interactions are driven by and can change social conventions. Research is needed to reveal the principles that will ensure that the network continues to grow productively. Research is required to implement principles that can settle complex issues such as privacy protection and intellectual property rights. Of course, we cannot predict what this nascent discipline might reveal. But Web science has already generated powerful insights, how the Web is structured, how resilient it is, how ideas travel through the tens of millions of blogs, how we might include information in Web content so that its accuracy and origin is more transparent. At the micro scale, the Web is an infrastructure of artificial languages and protocols; it is a piece of engineering. However, it is fundamentally about the interaction of human beings creating, linking and consuming information. It is this interaction that we also need to research and understand. It is this interaction that generates the Web\u0027s behavior as emergent properties at the macro scale. These macro properties are often surprising and require analytic methods to understand them. The Web’s use is part of a wider system of human interaction – the Web has had profound effects on society, with each emerging wave creating both new challenges and new opportunities available to wider sectors of the population than ever before.    The Web Science Research Initiative (WSRI) was launched in November 2006 by Tim Berners-Lee, Wendy Hall, Nigel Shadbolt and Daniel Weitzner. At WWW2007 in Banff, WSRI sponsored a reception to present the ideas behind Web Science to the WWW community. At WWW2008, WSRI sponsored a workshop entitled “Understanding Web Evolution: A Prerequisite for Web Science” chaired by Dave De Roure. It attracted a lot of excellent papers – see http://webscience.org/events/www2008/ - and was one of the largest workshops at the conference. In March 2009, WSRI is running its first Web Science conference in Athens, WebSci’09 – see www.websci09.org - with the aim of bringing computer scientists and social scientists together to discuss this important topic.    The aim of this panel is to bring this debate to the heart of the WWW community at WWW2009 in Madrid. "}
