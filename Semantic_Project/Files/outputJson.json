Compared with other biochemical systems, the modelling of cell signalling systems faces additional difficulties related to the challenges quantifying protein-protein processes but also to the lack of complete information about the topology of the considered network interactions. Since in most of the metabolic systems the complete network of interactions is (virtually) perfectly established, in cell signalling systems the real structure of the pathways is an open question to be elucidated either in parallel or through mathematical modelling based analysis. In this talk we discuss the use of power-law models (advantages and challenges) in biochemical systems. We also show how pre-existent biological knowledge and quantitative data can be integrated through mathematical modelling to validate hypothesis about the structure of signalling pathways."}

It then intoroduces logic which gives the learner techniques for distinguishing between correct and incorrect arguments using propositions and their connectives. A grasp of sets of real numbers on which we define elementary functions is essential. The need to have pictorial representations of a function necessitates the study of its graph. Note that the concept of a function can also be viewed as an instruction to be carried out on a set of objects. This necessitates the study of arrangements of objects in a certain order, called permutations and combinations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnit 2: Binary Operations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIn this unit we look at the concept of binary operations.

These are essentially sets of numbers or objects which satisfy some given axioms. The concepts of subgroup and subring are also important to study here. For the sake of looking at cases of fewer axiomatic demands we will also study the concepts of homomorphisms and isomorphisms. Here we will be reflecting on the concept of a mapping or a function from either one group to the other or from one ring to the other in order to find out what properties such a function has.\u0027\u003c/p\u003e"}

It can be viewed online or downloaded as a zip file. It is as taught in 2009-2010. This module introduces mathematical analysis building upon the experience of limits of sequences and properties of real numbers and on calculus. It includes limits and continuity of functions between Euclidean spaces, differentiation and integration. A variety of very important new concepts are introduced by investigating the properties of numerous examples, and developing the associated theory, with a strong emphasis on rigorous proof. This module is suitable for study at undergraduate level 2. Dr Joel Feinstein, School of Mathematical Sciences Dr Joel Feinstein is an Associate Professor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Nottingham. After reading mathematics at Cambridge, he carried out research for his doctorate at Leeds. He held a postdoctoral position in Leeds for one year, and then spent two years as a lecturer at Maynooth (Ireland) before taking up a permanent position at Nottingham. His main research interest is in functional analysis, especially commutative Banach algebras. Dr Feinstein has published two case studies on his use of IT in the teaching of mathematics to undergraduates. In 2009, Dr Feinstein was awarded a University of Nottingham Lord Dearing teaching award for his popular and successful innovations in this area."}

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals. The necessary linear algebra is also discussed to avoid including additional requirements for this course.Recorded on March 3, 2014Required attribution: Enciso, German A.

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals.

(NB: Viewers may wish to brush up on the work of computer pioneer Alan Turing and philosopher John Searle in preparation for this video.)  Ray Kurzweil confidently states that artificial intelligence will, in the not distant future, master human intelligence. He cites the exponential power of growth in technology that will enable both a minute, detailed understanding of the human brain, and the capacity for building a machine that can at least simulate original thought. The frontier such a machine must cross is emotional intelligencebeing funny, expressing loving sentiment And when this occurs, says Kurzweil, its not entirely clear that the entity will have achieved consciousness, since we have no consciousness detector to determine if it is capable of subjective experiences.  Acknowledging that his position will prove unpopular, David Gelernter launches his attack: We wont even be able to build super-intelligent zombies unless we approach the problem right. This means admitting that a continuum of cognitive styles exists among humans. As for building a conscious machine, he sees no possibility of one emerging from even the most sophisticated software. Consciousness means the presence of mental states strictly private with no visible functions or consequences. A conscious entity can call on a thought or memory merely to feel happy, be inspired, soothed, feel anger Software programs, by definition, can be separated out, peeled away and run in a logically identical way on any computing platform. How could such a program spontaneously give rise to a new node of consciousness?  Kurzweil concedes the difficulty of defining consciousness, but does not want to wish away the concept, since it serves as the basis for our moral and ethical systems. He maintains his argument that reverse engineering of the human brain will enable machines that can act with a level of complexity, from which somehow consciousness will emerge.  Gelernter replies that believing this seems a completely arbitrary claim. Anything might be true, but I dont see what makes the claim plausible. Ultimately, he says, Kurzweil must explain objectively and scientifically what consciousness is -- how its created and got there. Kurzweil stakes his claim on our future capacity to model digitally the actions of billions of neurons and neurotransmitters, which in humans somehow give rise to consciousness. Gelernter believes such a machine might simulate mental states, but not actually pass muster as a conscious entity. Ultimately, he questions the desirability of building such computers: We might reach the state some day when we prefer the company of a robot from Walmart to our next-door neighbor or roommates."}

Although the concerted efforts of northern Peace Democrats and a palpable war weariness among the electorate made Lincoln\u0027s victory uncertain, timely Union victories in Atlanta and Mobile in September of 1864 secured Lincoln\u0027s re-election in November. This lecture concludes Professor Blight\u0027s section on the war, following Lee and Grant to Appomattox Courthouse, and describing the surrender of Confederate forces. The nature of Reconstruction and the future of the South, however, remained open questions in April of 1865.      **Reading assignment:**    Michael P.

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals. The necessary linear algebra is also discussed to avoid including additional requirements for this course.Recorded on January 8, 2014Required attribution: Enciso, German A.

Speculation and the development of new theories are crucial as well, but ultimately the predictions resulting from those theories have to be tested against what actually happens and this can only be done by making further measurements. Whether measurements are made using simple instruments such as rulers and thermometers, or involve sophisticated devices such as electron microscopes or lasers, there are decisions to be made about how the results are to be represented, what units of measurements will be used and the precision to which the measurements will be made. In this unit we will consider these points in turn."}

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals. The necessary linear algebra is also discussed to avoid including additional requirements for this course.Recorded on March 14, 2014Required attribution: Enciso, German A.

It can be viewed online or downloaded as a zip file. As taught in Autumn Semester 2009/10 The aim of this short unit is to motivate students to understand why we might want to do proofs (why proofs are important and how they can help us) and to help students with some of the relatively routine aspects of doing proofs. In particular, the student will learn the following: * proofs can help you to really see why a result is true; * problems that are easy to state can be hard to solve (e.g. Fermat\u0027s Last Theorem); * sometimes statements which appear to be intuitively obvious may turn out to be false (e.g. Simpson\u0027s paradox); * the answer to a question will often depend crucially on the definitions you are working with; * how to start proofs; * how and when to use definitions and known results. The module is organised into three sections: Why; How (Part I); How (Part II) With practice, students should become fluent in these routine aspects of writing proofs, and this will allow them to focus instead on the more creative and interesting aspects of constructing proofs. A practice sheet is included after students have completed all three sections. Each section is suitable for a different level of audience, as described below: Suitable for: Foundation, undergraduate year one and undergraduate year two students Section 1: Why: Anyone with a knowledge of elementary algebra and prime numbers, as may be obtained by studying A level mathematics. (Foundation) Section 2: How (Part I)  Suitable for anyone with a knowledge of elementary algebra (including odd numbers, multiples of eight and the binomial theorem for expanding powers of (a+b)), and functions from the set of real numbers to itself (odd functions, even functions, multiplication and composition of functions). (Undergraduate year one) Section 3: How (Part II)  Requires some background knowledge of convergence and divergence of series of real numbers. A revision sheet is available. (Undergraduate year two) Dr Joel Feinstein, School of Mathematical Sciences Dr Joel Feinstein is an Associate Professor in Pure Mathematics at the University of Nottingham. After reading mathematics at Cambridge, he carried out research for his doctorate at Leeds. He held a postdoctoral position in Leeds for one year, and then spent two years as a lecturer at Maynooth (Ireland) before taking up a permanent position at Nottingham. His main research interest is in functional analysis, especially commutative Banach algebras. Dr Feinstein has published two case studies on his use of IT in the teaching of mathematics to undergraduates. In 2009, Dr Feinstein was awarded a University of Nottingham Lord Dearing teaching award for his popular and successful innovations in this area"}

We describe the basic qualitative behavior of dynamical systems in the context of a simple population model. As time allows, we will then discuss other types of models such as chemical reactions inside the cell, or excitable systems leading to oscillations and neuronal signals. The necessary linear algebra is also discussed to avoid including additional requirements for this course.Recorded on January 22, 2014Required attribution: Enciso, German A.

In linear algebra, the lecture starts with the definition of vectors spaces,  dimension, basis, span of vectors and so forth. Norms and dot products as well  as Hilbert spaces are introduced. Then the problem of solving linear system is  tackled, introducing matrices, eigenvalues... and some common factorization  (SVD, LU, Choleski, QR).  In probabilities, we start from the definition of discrete and continuous random  variables, give common examples, introduce the concepts of independence and  conditional probabilities. We tackle estimation through Bayes framework, give  the basic definitions in information theory (entropy, Kullback-Leibler  divergence) and introduce error bounds (Hoeffding bounds).  Optimization is briefly introduced defining extrema and convex functions. An  example of constrained minimization is demonstrated."}

In this talk, I introduce the idea of a cautious oracle as a more human version of Turings oracles. Nevertheless, I show that even this fails to capture the essence of the full capabilities of our understanding.    I raise the issue of possible physical processes that would appear to be needed in order to circumvent these Gdel-type restrictions. At the end of the talk, I report on some startling new experiments, which appear to point to new insights into the possible physical processes underlying conscious brain activity, and I speculate on how this might relate to the power of human understanding."}

A study of basic calculus as part of a liberal education. It emphasizes conceptual learning and stresses the connections between mathematics and modern society. Topics include functions, limits, derivatives, and an introduction to integral, with interesting real-life applications throughout. Students are familiarized with the many different interpretations of the derivative as a rate of change, and the integral as a total rate of change. This enables them to learn and practice modeling in a variety of situations from economics the social and the life sciences."}

They are not about particular learning algorithms; they are about the basic concepts and tools upon which such algorithms are built. Often students feel intimidated by such material: there is a vast amount of \\\"classical mathematics\\\", and it can be hard to find the wood for the trees. The main topics of these lectures are Lagrange multipliers, functional analysis, some notes on matrix analysis, and convex optimization. I\u0027ve concentrated on things that are often not dwelt on in typical CS coursework. Lots of examples are given; if it\u0027s green, it\u0027s a puzzle for the student to think about. These lectures are far from complete: perhaps the most significant omissions are probability theory, statistics for learning, information theory, and graph theory. I hope eventually to turn all this into a series of short tutorials. Please let me know of any errors, etc. ; ://from Chris Burges homepage : [[http://research.microsoft.com/~cburges]] **Lecture contains:**\\ Lagrange multipliers: * Lagrange the Mathematician * Lagrange multipliers: an indirect approach can be easier * Multiple Equality Constraints * Multiple Inequality Constraints * Two points on a d-sphere * The Largest Parallelogram * Resource allocation * A convex combination of numbers is maximized by choosing the largest * The Isoperimetric problem * For fixed mean and variance, which univariate distribution has maximum entropy? * An exact solution for an SVM living on a simplex Notes on some Basic Statistics * Probabilities can be Counter-Intuitive (Simpson\u0027s paradox; the Monty Hall puzzle) * IID-ness: Measurement Error decreases as 1/sqrt{n} * Correlation versus Independence * The Ubiquitous Gaussian: ** Product of Gaussians is Gaussian ** Convolution of two Gaussians is a Gaussian ** Projection of a Gaussian is a Gaussian ** Sum of Gaussian random variables is a Gaussian random variables ** Uncorrelated Gaussian variables are also independent ** Maximum Likelihood Estimates for mean and covariance (prove required matrix identities) ** Aside: For 1-dim Laplacian, max. likelihood gives the median * Using cumulative distributions to derive densities Principal Component Analysis and Generalizations * Ordering by Variance * Does Grouping Change Things? * PCA Decorrelates the Samples * PCA gives Reconstruction with Minimal Mean Squared Error * PCA preserves Mutual Information on Gaussian data * PCA directions lie in the span of the data * PCA: second order moments only * The Generalized Rayleigh Quotient ** Non-orthogonal principal directions ** OPCA ** Fisher Linear Discriminant ** Multiple Discriminant Analysis Elements of Functional Analysis * High Dimensional Spaces * Is Winning Transitive? * Most of the Volume is Near the Surface: Cubes * Spheres in n-dimensions * Banach Spaces, Hilbert Spaces, Compactness * Norms * Useful Inequalities (Minkowski and Holder) * Vector Norms * Matrix Norms * The Hamming Norm * L1, L2, L_infty norms - is L0 a norm? * Example: Using a Norm as a Constraint in Kernel Algorithms"}

Such models are generally described by partial differential equations (PDE) and for this reason much of the course is devoted to the analysis of PDE. Examples of applications come from physics, chemistry, biology, complex systems: traffic flows, shock waves, hydraulic jumps, bio-fluid flows, chemical reactions, diffusion, heat transfer, population dynamics, and pattern formation."}
